# QuantumProject

Quantum inspire is needed to run.
By just pulling the project in some of our members the code didn't work, so if you come across the same problem please just install quantuminspire and qiskit like it is showed in this video https://youtu.be/RIPfGD6hBAM. Then you can run the .py files.
