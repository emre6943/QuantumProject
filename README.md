# Quantum Engineering Group Project: Grover's Algorithm

In this repository, you can find the code we used to run Grover's algorithm on physical backends using Quantum Inspire by QuTech. 

Note that to run these files, `quantuminspire` and `qiskit` need to be installed. (See https://youtu.be/RIPfGD6hBAM for more details on the installation process.)

The repository contains these files:
* `grover.py` - implementation of Grover's algorithm for any number of qubits and search elements
* `watson.py` - implementation of Grover's algorithm inspired by Watson et al. (2018) for 2 qubits and 1 search element
* TODO: add file on sudoku.
